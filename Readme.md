This app is a web application that allows users to manage their partners. The backend of the app is built using Node.js and JWT for authentication, while the frontend is built using React.js. The app uses a MySQL database to store user and partner data.

Users can log in to the app using their email and password. Once authenticated, they are redirected to a dashboard page that displays stats and charts about their partners.

The app also uses Axios to make API calls to the backend, and the API is configured using environment variables. The backend uses JWT for authentication, and partners' data is stored in a MySQL database. The app provides endpoints to get all users, get all partners, add a partner, update a partner, and delete a partner.
